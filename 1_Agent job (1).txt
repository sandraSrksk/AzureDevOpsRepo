2023-05-23T15:35:56.3908354Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2023-05-23T15:35:56.3910685Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2023-05-23T15:35:56.3911676Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2023-05-23T15:35:56.3911901Z 
2023-05-23T15:35:56.3912726Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2023-05-23T15:35:56.3913126Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2023-05-23T15:35:56.3913265Z 
2023-05-23T15:35:56.3913837Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2023-05-23T15:35:56.3914174Z 
2023-05-23T15:35:56.3914593Z Or undo this operation with:
2023-05-23T15:35:56.3914719Z 
2023-05-23T15:35:56.3915192Z   git switch -
2023-05-23T15:35:56.3915444Z 
2023-05-23T15:35:56.3916051Z Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
